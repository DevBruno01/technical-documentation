            <header>What is Python</header>
            <p>Let's start by defining exactly what Python is. Python is a computer programming language. Or, in other
                words, a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform tasks. Its
                original creator, Guido van Rossum, named it after the BBC television show 'Monty Python's Flying
                Circus.' Hence, you'll find that Python books, code examples, and documentation sometimes contain
                references to this television show.</p>
            <p>Python is considered to be easy to learn, and it's designed around a set of clearly defined principles
                (the Zen of Python) that encourage the Python core developers to make a language that is unambiguous and
                easy to use.</p>

            <header>What is Python used for</header>
            <p>People use Python in many places. Its rich base library makes it excellent for all kinds of little helper
                scripts. But it scales just as well to large systems. To illustrate, YouTube's original creators used
                Python for the most part! Dropbox, as far as I know, is primarily written in Python as well. And did you
                know Instagram's entire backend and website are written in Python as well?</p>
            <p>You can use Python to automate tasks, perform calculations, create user interfaces, create website
                backends, access databases, download information from the Internet, etc. It's a versatile language that
                is easy to learn and write, and although perfect for beginning programmers, is just as useful and
                powerful for seasoned professionals.</p>
            <p>Python is extremely popular in a quickly growing field of expertise called data science. Many data
                scientists use Python for their day-to-day work. And these are just a few examples. If you start looking
                closely, Python is very ubiquitous.</p>
            <p>Many people say that Python comes with batteries included. It's a fun way of stating that it includes a
                comprehensive base library. In addition to this, you can find hundreds of thousands of external packages
                contributed by the enormous community. You'll find supporting base libraries and packages for pretty
                much anything you want to accomplish.</p>

            <header>What are Python's major features</header>
            <p>So what makes Python such a popular programming language? Youâ€™ll find out when reading this Python
                tutorial for beginners, but I can already show you some of the advantages to whet your appetite!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It's easy to read and write</li>
                <li>You don't need to manually compile your program</li>
                <li>Dynamically typed</li>
                <li>Python does support typing</li>
                <li>Garbage collection</li>

        <section id="What_is_Python's_popularity" class="main-section">
            <header>What is Python's popularity</header>
            <p>It's hard to measure the popularity of programming languages, and there are many different top lists and
                ranking systems out there. As an example, Python comes in second place on a well-known list of popular
                programming languages since January 2021. Javascript, due to its stronghold as a web development
                language, is often number one, though. This is obviously linked to the fact that you have no choice when
                it comes to browser languages.</p>
            <p>Python's popularity is a great advantage. There are vast amounts of tutorials, books, courses, sample
                code, and help available. Python is here to stay so if you want to learn Python: it's a safe bet! In
                fact, Python jobs are generally raking high on the pay scale. This Python tutorial for beginners should
                give you a great start in thoroughly learning Python and advancing your career.</p>

        <section id="Python_history" class="main-section">
            <header>Python history</header>
            <p>We've touched the subject a little already, but let's explore why Python came to be. It all started on a
                cold, foggy night in December 1987, when a Dutch scientist called Guido van Rossum woke up in the middle
                of the night. He just had a profound dream, and although he didn't know it at the time, that dream would
                eventually change his life and the lives of many others.</p>
            <p>So he got out of bed and slipped into his pantofles. After throwing some wood in the almost smothered
                fireplace, he started jotting down as much of this dream as he could remember. A new programing language
                was born: Python.</p>
